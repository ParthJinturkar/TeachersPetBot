### File highlighting the changes made to the previous version of the project.

We have made the following changes in the previous version:

- We enabled pylint on all files, which was previously only running on an empty src directory, leading to a 10/10 rating.
- We have seperated all the commands and have given them a seperate file so that the project looks more modular, cleand and robust.
- We have introduced the usage of cogs in the project which makes it easier to read and understand the different commands.
- As a result of these changes the different commands need not have any interaction (unless otherwise required) and exist independently.
- The previous version used another bot to test their main bot. This was more of a reading process rather than testing the bot. We have introduced a complete package of testing commands and have covered majority of the parts. 
- We have updated a lot many source files so that they work correctly and removed the bugs previously present.
- We implemented a newer method of handling code in this project as the previous one had some problems and did not provide us with the required results.
