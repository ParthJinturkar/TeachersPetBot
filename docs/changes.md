### File highlighting the changes made to the previous version of the project.

We have made the following changes in the previous version:

- We enabled pylint on all files, which was previously only running on an empty src directory, leading to a 10/10 rating.
- We have seperated all the commands and have given them a seperate file so that the project looks more modular, cleand and robust.
- We have introduced the usage of cogs in the project which makes it easier to read and understand the different commands.
