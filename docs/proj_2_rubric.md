# Project2.

This project has the same structure as Project1. That is, you are trying to write code that some other group will agree to extend in Project3.

**Important Notes**: 
- Copy the following rubric to a markdown file. Fill it in. Where needed, add links into your repo to justify your answers. And that document to your repo as docs/proj2rubric.md.
- The following table has two new rows (see last two)
- We are need to see a  **significant improvement** in Project2, compared to Project2. So some of these rows score **much more** than the others.
- As to the other rows, they are sorted in a particular way. In Project1, only the high scoring teams succeeded on the later items. So, if you want to get good mark in project2,
pay extra attention to the latter rows.

|Score|Notes|Evidence|
|---|-----|---------|
|.5| short release cycles| 2 release cycles|
|.5| workload is spread over the whole team (so one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others...|Divided at regularly scheduled meetings|
|.5|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing |Each command has a dedicated file that explains use of the command with an accompanying gif|
|.5|the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up  | Commands have been updated to use Cogs, a modular way of adding commands to the project|
|.5|Docs: doco generated , format not ugly  | [Command Details](https://github.com/War-Keeper/TeachersPetBot/blob/main/docs/Command_Details) and the readme file. Each method has individual documentation in-file |
|.5|evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people) | All team members used Pycharm with Pyling and all relevant requirements installed |
|.5|evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base |Use of the cogs system lets everyone work independently while keeping the bot in working condition|
|1|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation)  | [Command Details](https://github.com/War-Keeper/TeachersPetBot/blob/main/docs/Command_Details)|

|.5|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code. | Each file in [Command Details](https://github.com/War-Keeper/TeachersPetBot/blob/main/docs/Command_Details) and also the video in the README|
|.5|test cases exist  | [Test Folder](https://github.com/War-Keeper/TeachersPetBot/blob/main/test/test_bot.py), and conftest.py used with Github actions|

|.5|other automated analysis tools  | [Code cov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/War-Keeper/TeachersPetBot), [pylint](https://github.com/War-Keeper/TeachersPetBot/blob/main/.pylintrc) Used along with Github actions|
|.5|test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases. | [fixing bugs 1](https://github.com/War-Keeper/TeachersPetBot/issues/25), [fixing bugs 2](https://github.com/War-Keeper/TeachersPetBot/issues/18), [fixing bugs 3](https://github.com/War-Keeper/TeachersPetBot/issues/25)|

Please contact the group whose work you are extending. Ask from their grading rubric and its scores.
If that grading show any problem areas, you need to fix them (otherwise you will lose marks this time around).
